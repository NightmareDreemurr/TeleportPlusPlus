This mod is inspired by the functionality of EssentialsX (https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials),
a popular Bukkit/Spigot plugin licensed under GPLv3.

TeleportPlusPlus is a fresh implementation for NeoForge, bringing similar teleportation 
features to the NeoForge platform. This is not a fork or derivative of the EssentialsX 
codebase, but rather a new implementation inspired by its feature set.
